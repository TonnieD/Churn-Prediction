# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
This project explores customer churn in a telecom company. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns associated with churn, and build a model that predicts which customers are likely to leave.

## 2. Business Problem

**As a stakeholder:**  
You're a Customer Retention Manager at a telecom company. You've noticed a rise in customer churn over the last quarter. The company wants to reduce churn by identifying at-risk customers early and intervening with retention strategies.

### Objectives:
- Understand which factors most influence churn
- Build a model to predict the likelihood of churn
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn
